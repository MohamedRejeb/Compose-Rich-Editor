/**
 * Basic composable that enables users to edit rich text via hardware or software keyboard, but provides no decorations like hint or placeholder.
 * Whenever the user edits the text, [onValueChange] is called with the most up to date state represented by [RichTextValue]. [RichTextValue] contains the text entered by user, as well as selection, cursor, text composition information and rich text information. Please check [RichTextValue] for the description of its contents.
 * It is crucial that the value provided in the onValueChange is fed back into BasicRichTextEditor in order to have the final state of the text being displayed.
 *
 * BasicRichTextEditor is a wrapper around [BasicTextField] and it accepts all the parameters that [BasicTextField] accepts.
 *
 * This composable provides basic rich text editing functionality, however does not include any
 * decorations such as borders, hints/placeholder. A design system based implementation such as
 * Material Design Filled text field is typically what is needed to cover most of the needs. This
 * composable is designed to be used when a custom implementation for different design system is
 * needed.
 *
 * @param value The [RichTextValue] to be shown in the
 * [BasicRichTextEditor].
 * @param onValueChange Called when the input service updates the values in [RichTextValue].
 * @param modifier optional [Modifier] for this text field.
 * @param enabled controls the enabled state of the [BasicRichTextEditor]. When `false`, the text
 * field will be neither editable nor focusable, the input of the text field will not be selectable
 * @param readOnly controls the editable state of the [BasicRichTextEditor]. When `true`, the text
 * field can not be modified, however, a user can focus it and copy text from it. Read-only text
 * fields are usually used to display pre-filled forms that user can not edit
 * @param textStyle Style configuration that applies at character level such as color, font etc.
 * @param keyboardOptions software keyboard options that contains configuration such as
 * [KeyboardType] and [ImeAction].
 * @param keyboardActions when the input service emits an IME action, the corresponding callback
 * is called. Note that this IME action may be different from what you specified in
 * [KeyboardOptions.imeAction].
 * @param singleLine when set to true, this text field becomes a single horizontally scrolling
 * text field instead of wrapping onto multiple lines. The keyboard will be informed to not show
 * the return key as the [ImeAction]. [maxLines] and [minLines] are ignored as both are
 * automatically set to 1.
 * @param maxLines the maximum height in terms of maximum number of visible lines. It is required
 * that 1 <= [minLines] <= [maxLines]. This parameter is ignored when [singleLine] is true.
 * @param minLines the minimum height in terms of minimum number of visible lines. It is required
 * that 1 <= [minLines] <= [maxLines]. This parameter is ignored when [singleLine] is true.
 * @param onTextLayout Callback that is executed when a new text layout is calculated. A
 * [TextLayoutResult] object that callback provides contains paragraph information, size of the
 * text, baselines and other details. The callback can be used to add additional decoration or
 * functionality to the text. For example, to draw a cursor or selection around the text.
 * @param interactionSource the [MutableInteractionSource] representing the stream of
 * [Interaction]s for this TextField. You can create and pass in your own remembered
 * [MutableInteractionSource] if you want to observe [Interaction]s and customize the
 * appearance / behavior of this TextField in different [Interaction]s.
 * @param cursorBrush [Brush] to paint cursor with. If [SolidColor] with [Color.Unspecified]
 * provided, there will be no cursor drawn
 * @param decorationBox Composable lambda that allows to add decorations around text field, such
 * as icon, placeholder, helper messages or similar, and automatically increase the hit target area
 * of the text field. To allow you to control the placement of the inner text field relative to your
 * decorations, the text field implementation will pass in a framework-controlled composable
 * parameter "innerTextField" to the decorationBox lambda you provide. You must call
 * innerTextField exactly once.
